	abstract = {It is often assumed that a fundamental property of language is the arbitrariness of the relationship between sound and meaning. Sound symbolism, which refers to non-arbitrary mapping between the sound of a word and its meaning, contradicts this assumption. Sensitivity to sound symbolism has been studied through crossmodal correspondences ({CCs}) between auditory pseudowords (e.g. ‘loh-moh’) and visual shapes (e.g. a blob). We used representational similarity analysis to examine the relationships between physical stimulus parameters and perceptual ratings that varied on dimensions of roundedness and pointedness, for a range of auditory pseudowords and visual shapes. We found that perceptual ratings of these stimuli relate to certain physical features of both the visual and auditory domains. Representational dissimilarity matrices ({RDMs}) of parameters that capture the spatial profile of the visual shapes, such as the simple matching coefficient and Jaccard distance, were significantly correlated with those of the visual ratings. {RDMs} of certain acoustic parameters of the pseudowords, such as the temporal fast Fourier transform ({FFT}) and spectral tilt, that reflect spectral composition, as well as shimmer and speech envelope that reflect aspects of amplitude variation over time, were significantly correlated with those of the auditory perceptual ratings. {RDMs} of the temporal {FFT} (acoustic) and the simple matching coefficient (visual) were significantly correlated. These findings suggest that sound-symbolic {CCs} are related to basic properties of auditory and visual stimuli, and thus provide insights into the fundamental nature of sound symbolism and how this might evoke specific impressions of physical meaning in natural language.},

It simulates the early stages of lexical development in children, in particular, word confusion as evidenced in naming errors. The simulation results indicate that the rate of word confusion is modulated by developmental proﬁle of vocabulary increase, word density of competing neighbors, and rate of lexical growth. These results match up with hypotheses from empirical research on lexical development.},

The original model consists of two self-organizing maps (respectively, visual and acoustic) connected with Hebbian connections. With respect to the original model, our proposal adds two major features. First, our model follows a dynamic training regime, learning categories and word-object associations that evolve through time. Second, the visual and acoustic maps are Growing self-organizing maps that grow during training, when they are no longer able to consistently represent categories. With these two new characterizing features, our model replicates the performance of the original Mayor and Plunkett (2010)’s model, acquires psychological plausibility in the training regime, and avoids the risk of catastrophic interference.

	abstract = {We present a neurocomputational model with self-organizing maps that accounts for the emergence of taxonomic responding and fast mapping in early word learning, as well as a rapid increase in the rate of acquisition of words observed in late infancy. The quality and efficiency of generalization of word–object associations is directly related to the quality of prelexical, categorical representations in the model. We show how synaptogenesis supports coherent generalization of word– object associations and show that later synaptic pruning minimizes metabolic costs without being detrimental to word learning. The role played by joint-attentional activities is identified in the model, both at the level of selecting efficient cross-modal synapses and at the behavioral level, by accelerating and refining overall vocabulary acquisition. The model can account for the qualitative shift in the way infants use words, from an associative to a referential-like use, for the pattern of overextension errors in production and comprehension observed during early childhood and typicality effects observed in lexical development. Interesting by-products of the model include a potential explanation of the shift from prototype to exemplarbased effects reported for adult category formation, an account of mispronunciation effects in early lexical development, and extendability to include accounts of individual differences in lexical development and specific disorders such as Williams syndrome. The model demonstrates how an established constraint on lexical learning, which has often been regarded as domain-specific, can emerge from domain-general learning principles that are simultaneously biologically, psychologically, and socially plausible.},

The psychophysical functions relating perceived distance from the original to each level of distortion were linear. The level of distortion was calculated from the statistical rule generating the distortions and expressed in terms of uncertainty. It also reflected the mean distance that each dot actually gravitated over random samples of the rule. The perceived distance between any pair of distortions increased with the level of the more distorted from the original. The level of distortion of a sample of patterns was related to the rate at which Ss learned a common response to that sample. Rate of learning in classifying these patterns, like multivariate concept learning, is a function of the uncertainty within a category.},

Yet word learning presents a problem of induction that must somehow be solved by such very young children, with their limited information processing abilities. In order for children to acquire language as rapidly as they do, they must have biases that enable them to rule out many alternative hypotheses for the meanings of a word and that lead them instead to focus on hypotheses that are reasonably likely to be correct (Markman, 1989; Markman \& Hutchinson, 1984; Markman \& Wachtel, 1988). A sophisticated, intelligent adult, let alone a 2-year-old, would never be able to settle on the meaning of a word by open-mindedly considering every possible hypothesis and waiting for evidence that would rule out all but one (Quine, 1960). It has been suggested that children use several assumptions to solve the inductive problem posed by word learning; among these are the whole-object assumption, the taxonomic assumption, and the assumption of mutual exclusivity. In this chapter, I will review some of the evidence that children rely on these assumptions to guide their initial hypotheses about what words mean and will try to reconcile this argument with some conflicting evidence about whether these constraints are available to young children just starting to acquire language.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}span class='bold'{\textgreater}The taxonomic and whole-object assumptions{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}When an adult points to an object and labels it, the novel term could refer to an object category, but it could also refer to a part of the object or to its substance, color, or weight, and so on.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},
